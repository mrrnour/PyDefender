üõ°Ô∏è Introducing PyDefender!

Just dropped my latest tool: PyDefender - the all-in-one Python security scanner!
A comprehensive security scanner for Python packages that combines multiple security tools into a single interface.
In a nutshell
One command. Four security tools. Zero headaches.
Safety + pip-audit + Bandit + Semgrep = Complete protection
Why?
Got tired of running multiple security checks separately. Problem solved.
Try it:
bashCopypython pydefender.py requests  # Scan any package
python pydefender.py .         # Or your own code
Code is on GitHub: github.com/yourusername/pydefender
